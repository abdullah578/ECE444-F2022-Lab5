# Pros of TDD #

* Provides code documentation. Test cases show how the code should be used. 
* Better code quality 
* Reduces project costs in the long run since less defects are shipped to production code
* Can save time due to less debugging
* Easier code maintenance

# Cons of TDD #

* Longer development cycles. Changing the interface of the code will also require rewriting the test cases
* Can result in lots of test cases that are overly trivial
* Cannot find bugs introduced in both implementation and test code
